You are working in this repository. Your goal is to remove one arbitrary op-specific test constraint (or any subconstraint) from tests/test_codegen_ops.py and make the codegen_generic_backend work without it.

Rules

Pick exactly ONE op-specific constraint or subconstraint (e.g. a filter in CODEGEN_OP_TEST_CONFIG, a function like _matmul_sample_filter, a per-op constraint entry, or a constraint lambda).

Remove it or relax it (prefer fully removing).

Do NOT add new op-specific constraints. Do NOT reintroduce the same constraint elsewhere.

Do NOT reduce the operator list being tested.

Do NOT reduce the number of samples generated by OpInfo (no shrinking of sample generation).

Make the backend pass the full test suite by extending/bugfixing the backend implementation (or lowering) so it supports the newly-unconstrained cases.

If an op sample is invalid for eager (aten_overload raises), the test should skip that sample (but compiled must never raise when eager succeeds).

Prefer minimal, localized changes. Keep behavior consistent with eager.

Add regression tests only if needed; otherwise rely on existing tests.

Process

Identify the chosen constraint/subconstraint and where it is applied.

Delete/relax it.

Run the failing tests, capture the first failing op/sample, and determine what backend feature is missing.

Implement the missing backend support (shape/broadcast semantics, dtype handling, view/stride, reduction dims, etc.).

Iterate until all tests pass.

Provide a short summary: which constraint was removed, which backend changes were made, and which new cases are now supported.

Output a single unified diff patch (git apply format). No extra commentary outside the summary.
